I believe these are the top three browsers and chose them based on my prior experience with them. I will evaluate and contrast the three web browsers' performance, security/privacy, usability, web extensions, cross platform accessibility.</p>

    Performance, it's fast/lightweight and the use of efficient system resources. This would be a great ideal web browser for older/slow computers and laptops compared to Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. Opera built-in compression tool (Opera Turbo), it can intensify the speed, even with poor connections. 
    Security/privacy, has a built-in VPN and an ad blocker.  It also comes with robust phishing and malware protection built into Opera.
    The usability of Opera is very user-friendly and customizable. Easy and quick access to your sidebars and bookmark websites.
     Opera has some great built in extensions, like the store extension which makes it easy to view other extensions you may not know about. It can also use most of the chrome extensions. 
    It has a wide variety of platforms Opera could be run on, like Windows, macOS, Linux, IOS, and Android. As well, seamless syncing of bookmarks, history, and open tabs across all platforms. Opera does have 
    </li></ul></p></div>

    <div class="opera-cons"><p class="cons"><ul class="pros-dot"><li><strong class="cons-strong">Cons:</strong>
      While Opera usually performs well with older machines, it can become slow when use of multiple web extensions.
      Opera’s security/privacy has a basic built-in VPN and may not provide full privacy like the premium VPN service would. It’s also owned by a Chinese consortium, which  had some breaches from other software/websites in the past there.
      The usability may be overwhelming to new users due to the abundance of features and the overall usability. Some extensions from other web browsers may not be fully optimized on the use of Opera. 
      Opera’s cross platform accessibility on macOS is less optimized and supportive compared to Google Chrome and safari. 
      </li></ul></p></div>
    <div class="opera-overall"><p class="overall"><ul class="pros-dot"><li><strong>Overall:</strong>
      Opera is a great web browser for slower/low-end computers and laptops, but less updates and support then it should. It has great security/privacy features but is owned by a Chinese consortium, which may raise concerns for other users. I put Opera in second right behind Microsoft Edge due to the less frequent updates and support. It is great, but it has its issues and rather I use Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

    <div class="edge-pros"><p><ul class="pros-dot"><li><strong class="pros-strong">Pros:</strong>
      Caught up in terms of performance, now running on Chromium engine same as Google Chrome. Compared to other web browsers, it is notable for using less RAM and provides a quick browser performance. It is ideal for a laptop due to the battery optimization ability. 
      Microsoft Edge has a great privacy/security feature like InPrivate browsing and three tracking protection choices (Basic, Balanced, and Strict). On top they have integration with Microsoft Defender SmartScreen which filters out malicious/dangerous websites. 
      The usability is great due to it being on chromium engine which has a super user-friendly interface and the simplicity. Offers great built-in features like collection for organizing web applications and work phenomenal with windows integration.
      Edge web extensions priorities are performance and security and has its own extension store that is compatible with Google Chrome extensions. 
      Microsoft Edge is available on Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and Linux. Offering syncing across other devices.</li></ul></p></div>


    <div class="edge-cons"><p class="cons"><ul class="pros-dot"><li><strong class="cons-strong">Cons:</strong>
      It is not great with highly complex scripts or web applications because of built-in features like tracking prevention. It’s close connections with the Windows ecosystem, other users may issue it as a problem. 
      Due to its deep integration with the Windows ecosystem, may not be appealing to others that use different operating systems. 
      Microsoft Edge is still working on adding more extensions, so could be a turning point for users. The experience could be inconsistent across different operating systems.
    </li></ul></p></div>
    
    <div class="overall"><p class="overall"><ul class="pros-dot"><li><strong>Overall:</strong>
      Microsoft Edge would be the best pick for windows operating systems. It's very user-friendly, especially for newer users. The security and privacy features built-in for web applications is great for everyone. Has great  overall performance and management abilities included. The capability of saving anything and using that saved data in a different operating system, It’s ideal for school, work, research, shopping, and even entertainment. Overall, best out of the three web browsers.

      Performance, it is quick and responsive especially for heavy JavaScripted websites, it’s also well-suited for Google services. 
      The security/privacy Chrome is robust, offering sandboxing technology which is a cybersecurity strategy that runs code in an isolated environment. Also, automatic updates, an extensive collection of security and privacy addons, and offers Google Safe Browsing guards against viruses/malware. 
      Chrome is super user-friendly with easy navigation with other addons to help the user.
      Has the largest diverse extension library and connects smoothly with Google Services, which will help with users in the Google ecosystem. 
      Chrome is compatible across most of the major operating systems like Windows, macOs, Linux, iOS, and Android with syncing throughout all devices.
    </li></ul></p></div>


    <div class="edge-cons"><p class="cons"><ul class="pros-dot"><li><strong class="cons-strong">Cons:</strong>
      Not great for lower-end computers, using up a significant amount of RAM due to Chrome being a “memory hog”.
      In Chrome’s policies, they collect an extensive amount of user data for advertising purposes. 
      The interface seems outdated with years with relatively no changes. 
      Some extensions may be a security risk if not vetted correctly. The high usage of the devices resources is consistent throughout all systems.
    </li></ul></p></div>
    
    <div class="overall"><p class="overall"><ul class="pros-dot"><li><strong>Overall:</strong>
    Chrome is one the best web browsers out there, but the high resource usage and the personal data used for Chrome advertising are the main turning points. There is a slight sense of the outdatedness on the interface, but nothing too drastic. The speed and responsiveness is great and extensions with capabilities to Google services is a plus. I put it right under Microsoft Edge, due to the high resource usage.
